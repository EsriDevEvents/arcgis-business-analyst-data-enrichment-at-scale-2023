# ArcGIS Business Analyst: Data Enrichment at Scale

In this session we will use the Business Analyst extension for ArcGIS Pro to generate a tessellation for a nationwide dataset and enrich it with hundreds of variables. We will use Geoprocessing tools from ArcGIS Pro and the ArcGIS API for Python with ArcGIS Notebooks to build an effective pipeline for preparing data, selecting variables, and performing enrichment in an effective and scalable way.
